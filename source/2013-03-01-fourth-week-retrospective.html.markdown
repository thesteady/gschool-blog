####My Progress in gSchool

Another week down and a full month into gSchool. I feel like I have learned a lot and set a solid foundation for continuing to learn. That's good, since there is so much still to go! I have been making an effort to work hard when I'm working and to recognize when it's time for me to stop, when I'm no longer being productive.

It has been awesome to get to know all of my classmates. Coming into the program, I was a bit nervous about the class dynamics: would I get along with people? would there be anyone who drove me nuts? Being pretty laidback, I get along with _almost_ everyone in general, but being shoved together with a group for an intense 6 months made me a bit nervous about it anyway. I have been happy to find that everyone is supportive and helpful, and I am comfortable asking any of them questions about code and projects. I'm glad that my classmates have both patience and a sense of humor. It will be interesting to see how group dynamics develop over the next 5 months.


####TrafficSpy Project Thoughts

I think this week has been the toughest for me so far. We started a new project, TrafficSpy, which is like a simplified Google Analytics project to be built using Sinatra, Ruby, and PostgreSQL. We've been doing Ruby and I'm feeling more confident in using it, but Sinatra and PostgreSQL are new to the mix. In addition to having some stressful things going on outside of class, trying to learning two new technologies *AND* organize and start a project was hard to juggle. I spent a lot of the week feeling confused and frustrated, but things are starting to make more sense.

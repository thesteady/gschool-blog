For "Week 1" (aka the second week) of gSchool we tackled the EventReporter project. Built in Ruby, the EventReporter took a variety of prompts from the command line to load, parse, query, and output csv data related to a set of conference attendees. We had only from Monday afternoon to Thursday morning to get the full project working and submitted. It was intense, but the struggle to understand the project, implement it in code, and do it quickly taught me a lot about the process and about Ruby.

This project also gave me a better understanding of the process. I spent the first evening trying to take a previous, similar project (EventManager) and reform it to be better suited to the EventReporter. This ended up being the wrong road to go down (for me, at least). I found that it really hindered my ability to understand the new project, and so eventually started with a blank slate to design the outline of EventReporter, and then pull pieces of code I wanted to reuse from the previous project. Focusing on the project at hand, instead of the project behind me, felt like an important lesson for me to have learned on this project.

I also found that I can get quite a bit of focused work done after dinner. I don't consider myself a night owl, so my ability to sit down and really get a lot done at night surprised me. When I knew what I wanted to get written in the code, and had a good idea of how to do it, I was able to focus best at home. However, when I wasn't sure where to go, or how to do it, I found that working in the same space (at Galvanize) with other gSchoolers was really helpful. Bouncing ideas off of each other, having someone explain a concept to me (thanks, Raphael and Blair!), or explaining a concept to someone else, was really useful for decreasing the amount of time I spent going in the wrong direction or being lost with where to go. I didn't try getting up early to work for this project, but in the past I've been a productive early bird, so I plan to try this with my next project. Another thing I learned about my work pattern from this project is that when I'm tired and/or frustrated, I need to stop instead of becoming increasingly stressed about a coding problem. A few times leaving the project for a few hours to do something else let my mind digest the problem and come back to it with a better insight of how to fix it.

I learned a lot during this project. Monday, when I started the project, I really doubted my ability to complete it. BUT, I was able to successfully write all of the base requirements and have half-way decent code. I feel a lot more confident with my ability to code and learn to code, having this project behind me.

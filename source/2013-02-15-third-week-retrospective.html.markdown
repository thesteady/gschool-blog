Today marks the end of our third week at gSchool. We're midways through a Ruby project called SalesEngine, which has us building an API for interacting with a set of fake retail sales data including customers, merchants, items, and credit card transactions. It's an intense project, but I feel confident that my project partner and I can finish it. I'm actually surprised at how confident I feel about this -- I was much more intimidated by the project before this one. I hope that my confidence continues throughout gSchool (and into the real-world!). While I wouldn't call myself a developer yet, I do feel much more like one than when we first started class. I'm excited about how things change over the next 21 weeks! Thinking back over what I've learned in just three weeks, it's hard for me to imagine how much more I'll understand by the end of gSchool.

One of the reasons I've been able to learn so much is that Jeff knows how to push people to their limits. He could be giving us projects and tasks that only challenge us a little bit -- we'd learn something, but probably not a lot. By giving us tasks that at first seem overwhelmingly impossible to complete (or, sometimes, even start) he's forcing us to analyze the situation and break it into manageable parts. I think that's an incredibly important lesson for developers. In our jobs, we might be faced with designing and building something from the beginning, and we'll need to be tactical about how we approach such problems. To me, this method of teaching is probably one of the most valuable aspects of gSchool. Not just knowing how much to push, but to do it ways that never leave you feeling lost for too long -- just long enough that you appreciate and remember the solutions.

I'm also enjoying the structure of gSchool. It's been a mix of structured class time and unstructured project time. By doing pomodoros, we're never stuck in our seats for too long at a stretch, which makes getting through a day of fast-paced learning easier.

So far, the hardest part of gSchool for me is finding the right balance of school and personal life. I am trying to be diligent about taking at least one day off on the weekend to put school aside and recharge. Last weekend I went on a hike, this weekend I'll be snowshoeing. Sure, I could be working on something extra like learning vim or practicing my git-fu. But getting outside for some exercise is helping me show up on Mondays refreshed and ready to go. I think that in the long run this is more sustainable for me.

One more week down! Happy weekend, dear readers.

title: Don't Make Me Think, Week 1

Reading Steve Krug's _Don't Make Me Think_ immediately had me _thinking_ about how I could implement his wisdom into my blog and our current project, StoreEngine. Krug has a lot of interesting insight into how people use websites, and how designers should be careful not to overthink their design in ways that aren't helpful to those users. I thought one quote in particular really summed up Krug's message:

> If your audience is going to act like you're designing billboards, then design great billboards. p29

People scan websites rather than read them, and they look for information that is probably useful to them, instead of the best match (Krug calls this _satisficing_). If they can't find it pretty quickly, they'll give up and try a different site. Instead of making our websites having amazing, but subtle design, we should stop just short of hitting our users over their heads with the info they want.

Krug also emphasizes having clear and persistant navigation. I realized this the difficult way one night while working on our current project. I loaded up the new work that my teammates had done, and went to register a new account on our store. I clicked Login. Hmm, no option to create a new account there, so back to the home page. Wait, can I create a new account? Where is it? Did we not finish that part yet? It took me a minute or so to find the new account button ("Register"), which was right next to the Login button, but in an unexpected area at the top of the page. I'm not sure why I couldn't find the button, but doing so caused us to move the login and register buttons to the top right of the page and add a link to the register page from the login page.

I found the pictures in _Don't Make Me Think_ to be particularly interesting. Last updated in 2005, many of the example pictures of websites are from the first edition, published in 2000. Many of the websites that were then examples of best practices would now make people squeamish. They _look_ old. This got me thinking: how much of the advice that Krug gives are things we take for granted today? Web design has definitely come a long way in a decade, and I think many of the insights that Krug had in 2005 have become standard practice. As users, I think we even expect sites we visit to follow a lot these guidelines, even if we don't actually realize it. I know that when I stumble upon a poorly designed site, I get frustrated and less interested pretty quickly. For example,

>There's an emerging convention that the Site ID doubles as a button that can take you to the site's Home page. It's a useful idea that every site should implement, but a surprising number of users still aren't aware of it. p66

I think by now, most people _expect_ this to be the case, and are confused when it isn't.

I am definitely enjoying _Don't Make Me Think_, and looking forward to reading the second half in the upcoming week.

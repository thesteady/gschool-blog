Another week down! It's hard to grasp that there are only a few weeks left -- but yet still quite a lot of learning left in those weeks!

The job hunt process has been an interesting one so far, from both an individual perspective and as a group. I am definitely starting to get a better sense of the environment, subject matter, and group of people I want to surround myself with for my next adventure. Having previously worked in industries where the limited available jobs were highly competitive, I am still adjusting to the idea of being able to be somewhat selective. It's also something that I don't want to take for granted.

#### Project Thoughts

The current project is a Service-Oriented Architecture exercise revolving around real-time chat services. My group is working on a customer support application. I'm having fun working more with javascript, and looking forward to focusing more on it. This project is also making me realize how far I've progressed as a developer. I have a much better handle on how to write focused stories and then implement them. I find it really exciting! My goal for the next two weeks of this project are:

1. Write my best code -- TDD, clean and refactored with appropriate levels of abstraction.

2. Create some quality JS.
3. Complete the features we start -- and not add half-finished material that diminishes the quality of the overall project.

Have a good weekend!

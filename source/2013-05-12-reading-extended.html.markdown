Quick post: I've added an 'Extended Reading' page to my blog.

Throughout gSchool, I've been keeping a list of books that teachers, classmates, mentors, and guest speakers have recommended, in the hopes of reading some of them. It's in a bit of a rough draft form at the moment, but better than nothing. Please enjoy, and let me know if there's anything you'd like to see added!

#Hello, World! 

This is my blog for gSchool, where I'll chronicle my journey from ruby noob to web developer extraordinaire. I'm excited and nervous to immerse myself in a new world of knowledge and challenge myself in new ways.

We spent our first day working with Jessie Shternshus of [The IMPROV EFFECT](http://www.improveffect.com). It was a surprisingly fun and effective way to get all of the new gSchoolers talking to each other and learning each other's names. Since we'll be working together in pairs and on teams for the next 6 months, I really appreciated the communication strategies we learned. I also had a lot of fun on the Denver scavenger hunt we spent Wednesday afternoon completing. It was a great way to explore downtown Denver and get to know my teammates. I'm definitely impressed by the awesome group of students I'll be working with can't wait to see what we create!

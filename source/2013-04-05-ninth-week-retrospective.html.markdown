Wow. I am exhausted. This week was busy.

#### StoreEngine Retro

We turned in our StoreEngine project yesterday. My team pushed hard this week to make it the best site we could. I am really happy with our final product. We even made it to the demo round, and came in second place. Putting together a five-minute demo of our site in an hour was a challenge, and having it video-taped  made it more nerve-wracking. When we started our project, we certainly didn't have the demo in mind. That might be something I think about a little bit more the next time -- is this site relevant to other people, does it have an audience?

I definitely learned a lot about Rails, but feel like I have a lot left to learn. I had a hard time understanding customization of routes, but towards the end it started to click. Once I started to get more comfortable working with Rails, I really started to enjoy it. We also did internationalization, and I had fun creating a couple of fake languages (Creature-Speak, and Canadian, eh) for our site. It was neat to learn, and something that I can definitely see being useful in the future.

Reading _Don't Make Me Think_ while working on this project helped me to keep the usability of our site in focus. As I wrote about in a [previous post](/2013-03-31-don-t-make-me-think-week-1.html), I was more aware of when things were poorly placed, and tried to make sure we changed them. I also had fun learning more about CSS and layout implementation. I think I do a decent job of laying things out well, moving them around to position them where I want to, but my weak point is color design. Picking colors that go well together and using them in the right ways is hard for me. I had a hard time with this when I used to make a lot of maps. I've definitely improved, but want to keep working on that skill.

#### General Retro

This week my outside-of-school adventure was attending the Thoughtbot Drinkup, where CTO Joe Ferris gave a refactoring demo. He walked us through how he analyzed load speed for a process involving a lot of SQL queries, and his process for refactoring to have fewer queries and faster processing. Some of it was a bit over my head, but it was very interesting and I came away with some new ideas and lots to research.


#### What's On The Horizon?

This weekend I'll be finishing my reading for _Don't Make Me Think_ and meeting up with my mentor. I'm looking forward to it. Next week, we'll start the SonofStoreEngine Project, which I am a bit intimidated about, but excited for.

Happy Friday!

#### Project Thoughts

We have spent much of the past week on pulling out some of our functionality into a service. It's an interesting and technically-complex challenge. I think I'm learning a lot about working with separate service apps and about extracting and focusing functionality. Cool! I think our project still has a bit of a ways to go before Wednesday, so hopefully we'll get there! I've enjoyed working on JavaScript and jQuery to get one particular page ajaxed -- I don't think you ever have to refresh it (ok, well, almost)!


#### Big Picture Thoughts

With 3 weeks left in the program, everyone has been:
    a) worn out,
    b) focused on the job search,
    c) working on really cool stuff for their projects,
    d) all of the above.

It will be really interesting to see where everyone ends up. And, I'm glad that at least some people will be staying in the area! It will be interesting to see where I end up, too. I am excited about the places I've interviewed/am interviewing with.

What's up readers?

#### Mini-Project Retrospective

This week in gSchool, we split into three groups based on our current capabilities and worked on different projects. I was in the group that re-created SalesEngine while incorporating some changes. For the first SalesEngine, we used CSV files to load and parse the data. This time, we used a database to handle the data and used a Sinatra interface to handle the data browsing/searching. It was amazing to see how much faster the data parsing was by using a database instead of CSVs. Using a sqlite database also made it much easier to write relationships.

Because this week was about reinforcing our knowledge and catching up on things we didn't quite get the first time, I made a concious effort to really focus on clean code and TDD. It worked out pretty well! I had 100% test coverage with what I felt were good, useful tests. Instead of worrying about trying to get all of the project finished, I took more time to think about and play with alternative ways to do things, and some crazy refactoring. For instance, in class we wrote a has_many method from scratch. It was pretty cool to get working, and led some of us to try to create other relationship methods. We also worked on separating our main sinatra server file from the models (ruby classes) by inserting a controller between them. This process definitely helped me understand the RVMC architecture better.

Re-writing SalesEngine helped me to realize just how much I've learned since starting gSchool. My understanding of the code is much better, and my confidence in TDD and debugging has also increased. I also noticed that my ability to focus on the code and be methodical in my process has gotten better, as well. For the next week, my goal is to focus on always doing Pomodoros and making sure I get some exercise in.

#### Weekly Retrospective

What else happened this week?

Six of us are giving lightning talks on Arduino today. Mine is on Arduino Programming in C. Not having played with Arduino or C before, it took me a bit of time to understand what was going on. But, I'm excited to here the others' talks and hopefully play with an Arduino board this afternoon.

Yesterday, the Time Magazine article that was written about gSchool -- and other things -- came out (online at least, I think the print is coming out soon). It's always interesting to see how things are interpreted in the media, and this article is certainly no exception! More interesting, though, is the attention that gSchool is getting. When I signed on, I didn't really think of this as such a novel thing that it would be attention-worthy. But, I'm glad it is. I'm curious to see if it continues to increase during the program and afterwards. It couldn't hurt my job chances, right?

I think the most important thing I took away from this week was how far we have _all_ come in our mastery of ruby and coding in such a short time, and how incredibly awesome and supportive our group is.

Respect the Friday, and have a great weekend!

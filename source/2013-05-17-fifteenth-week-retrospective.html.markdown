Hi, there, blog-reading friends!

#### Boulder Startup Week

The best part of school was always the field trips. So it was awesome yesterday when we all clambered onto a limo-bus for a trip to Boulder Startup Week! We checked out LivingSocial, QuickLeft, and Gnip. I also made it to a portion of the Startup Crawl event, my mentor Eoin's talk about Open Source work, and the Boulder Ruby Users Group. I enjoyed meeting and talking to lots of other people attending BSW, and getting to see some of the companies around town. It was interesting to see the different workstation setups at the various places we went.


#### Project Thoughts: FeedEngine

We have completed week 2 out of 3 for FeedEngine, and API consuming-mashing-and-resupplying project. It's a cool project concept, and I am enjoying learning about working with APIs. Our progess on it isn't going as quickly as ideal, so I am a bit worried about what we'll actually have (or won't have) at the end. I'm not sure what the remedy for our slow pace is -- I think we've all been tired and a bit burnt out for the past couple of weeks, and taking turns feeling under the weather. We are all working hard, so hopefully we'll keep chugging along!

I have enjoyed spending some time building out jQuery functionality for some nice UI effects and working on the styling. I also experimented with mockups with Balsamiq. I'm finding it hard to juggle working on the backend AND the front-end, because I feel like there is so much to do in both places. I think the best balance is for me to do small iterations of building out functionality and then immediately switching to doing the design and getting it set. I'm looking forward to working with it all more over the weekend and next week.

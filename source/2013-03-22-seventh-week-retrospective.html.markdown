When you're busy learning, a week goes by quickly! I feel like I've learned a lot this week. We started working in Rails, began a new project, learned more about git from gitHubber Tim Berglund, and had an excellent lecture/conversation with Ben Orenstein of Thoughbot.

#### Getting on Track With Rails

Working in Rails is an interesting change of pace. Throughout the program, we've been building things the hard way first, and then learning the easier way to use code to build it for you. First it was parsing data from csv files. Next, we used a database to make it easier, but still needed to write relationships ourselves. Now, using Rails and ActiveRecord, it's already there! Also, we started working with websites using Sinatra, which requires you to do most of the route-writing and view building manually. Rails handles a lot of this, too!

#### Building a Blog Engine -- Blogger Tutorial

For my first Rails mini-project, I worked on the Blogger (building a blog engine). It felt almost like cheating to have Rails doing all the setup and relationship-building that I had been doing manually. I enjoyed it, though, as not worrying about the details of writing lots of ```find_by``` methods allowed me to focus more on the slightly larger picture, really understanding the relationships and how things were interacting. I think once I get more comfortable with the basics of Rails, I am going to love it!

#### Starting StoreEngine

We just started the StoreEngine project, which I am excited about. My most recent job was working at an online-retail store, so building my own (fake) online store feels very relevant to me. It's neat to see *and* _understand_ the internals.


#### Big Picture Retro

As we've gotten a solid foundation in Ruby and some databases, we've moved into studying Rails, HTML, CSS. It's pretty cool how much we've learned so far. Now that we're building web apps, I'm starting to feel more like a developer -- or at least like I can and will become one. I know I still have a long way to go, but that distance is getting shorter.

One thing I feel like I need more work with is HTML and CSS customizing, and I want to study up on Sass and JavaScript. We haven't had much (any?) dedicated class-time to learning these topics, and I feel like it could be beneficial. Customizing my blog a bit was instructive, but I spent a frustrating amount of time trying to figure out what the template CSS files were doing rather than experimenting with CSS and layouts.

Later, gator!

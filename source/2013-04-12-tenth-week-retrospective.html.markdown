What’s different about the larger project group? Have your communication tools (Tracker/Flowdock/Github) been more useful or just more confusing?
What’s it like working on a "legacy" project? What were the hardest parts about getting started? Do you feel like you understand the existing project yet?
What role(s) are you taking on in your current project? Are those the same or different than you’ve taken in past teams?
Now that you’ve had some time with Rails, what parts feel comfortable and what parts are still confusing? How will you practice the confusing parts?

#### Mentor Shout Out Time

My mentor is Eoin Coffey, an engineer at Gnip. We met up in Boulder last weekend, had some awesome tea, and geeked out over git for a while. We've also chatted via gchat some. It's exciting to get to know someone from outside of gSchool who can provide a different perspective on the world of programming. I'm looking forward to asking him questions about things I'm stumped on, and maybe doing some code reviews/pairing together.


#### General gSchool Thoughts

gSchool is going quickly. I'm learning a lot. When I started gSchool, the command line was a scary place for me _(what if I break my computer?)_ -- but now, I don't think twice about firing up the Terminal. I definitely have programming/language/side topic interests that I wish I could spend more time focusing on, and I often feel as if it's all I can do to keep up with projects and new topics.

I've started tracking my time spent on school work, using [Harvest](www.getharvest.com). The hardest part is remembering to start and stop the time tracker, but I'm starting to get used to it. It will be interesting to see how much time I actually spend on the project.

#### Looking Ahead

Bird migration is starting to pick up (if you don't already know, birding is kinda my thing). It's going to be hard to make time for birding with my busy gSchool schedule, but I am hoping to do some at least in the mornings before class a few days a week. My goal for next week is to try to go at least twice. I think the morning mental break from thinking about code and school, and the additional walking/outdoors time it will mean, will be good.

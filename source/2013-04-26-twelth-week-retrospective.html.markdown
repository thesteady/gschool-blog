Another week down! This week we:

1. Started a new project, Daughter of Store Engine,
2. Learned about site performance optimization and took a second look at controller testing from Franklin,
3. Had a great Happy Hour event at iTriage's office,
4. Continued reading about jQuery,
5. and, later today, will meet and hear from Erika Trautman, CEO of Flixmaster.


#### Current Project Thoughts

For the current project (the so-creatively named Daughter of Store Engine), I am working with Elaine, Kyle, and Aimee. They are all three great people to work with. We meshed as a group really quickly and we are all working well together. As we do more and more group-based projects, I am really coming to appreciate it when the entire team can help each other highlight strengths and build up weaknesses. We are also sticking pretty well to a git workflow of working on branches, pushing the branches up, and having someone else pull them down, check and merge them. It's definitely decreasing headaches caused by merge conflicts and disappearing code.

My group (Team Ballmer) is adding product/store ratings and reviews functionality to our multi-store platform. This project is supposed to be all about agile processes and client interaction, so we don't have pre-set specifications. It's a pleasant change from the last project's specifications and working with 'grumpy clients' whose purpose seemed to be to try to make our lives more difficult.

While Elaine, Kyle, Aimee and I are the official team for this project, we've gotten our mentors involved in helping us solve tricky problems and refactor code. It's really awesome to have people from outside of gSchool be excited about our learning and want to help us out.

#### Social Butterfly

Yesterday was a busy day for me, socially. We went to the iTriage Happy Hour in the early afternoon. It was great to meet the iTriage crew and see some of the work they're doing.

After iTriage, I went to a Girl Geek Dinners meetup, held at SendGrid (another beautiful office!). I really enjoy meeting the great people that go to this meetup, and the talks are always interesting. Last night, we heard from Suzanne Stoller, who works as Head of People Operations for Google. She had some great insights into working in the tech world, getting jobs at tech companies, and interesting thoughts on Google.

#### Looking Ahead

We'll continue working on our current project, which is due next Thursday. I am excited to hear from Erika Trautman later today, and to work on my new open source project! I'll write more about it next week, once I've gotten into it some. I am looking forward to working with my team more this weekend and getting a bit of sun, too. Next weekend I'm going camping!

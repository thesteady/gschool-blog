Hi again, reader(s?)! Another week at gSchool is coming to a close. It's reflection time:

#### Project Thoughts: Individual Project

We started our first individual project this week. On Tuesday, we were each given three cards two 'services' and one 'technology' to use for our project. We were allowed to swap for a while, so I ended up with MongoDB, Google Maps, and Instagram. None of the ideas I had been thinking about doing matched up well with the 'cards I was dealt', so I took a bit of time to mull over what I could do with the three things I had. 

My project 'Trekkr', will allow users to view geo-tagged Instagram photos of the Pacific Crest Trail on a map, so that they can take a virtual hike of the trail. Hiking a long trail like the PCT or the Appalachian Trail is something I'd love to do, but haven't because of a less-than-perfect knee. With my app, I'll be able to live vicariously through others (It's going to be a great procrastination tool.)!

I spent this week learning about MongoDB, exploring the Instagram API to figure out how to pull out the data I want, and getting the basics of my app coded out. I realized last night that I will have to re-work how I'm pulling in data from Instagram -- I need to use a different search type -- so, while I feel like I have a lot of work left to do, I think I am in decent shape to have a deliverable project by next Thursday. Working fully on my own definitely has a different feeling than working in a group. I'm the only one responsible for the code, and there is no one but my self to report to. My strategy for staying on task involves using Pivotal Tracker for my self, setting up daily goals and priorities, and stopping daily to review what I've done and where I need to be going.


#### Big Picture Musings

gSchool is over in seven weeks. Over that time, I really hope to focus in on learning JavaScript and honing my Ruby/Rails skills. Thinking about moving on to working full-time is exciting and intimidating. Being in gSchool, where we are all constantly pushing ourselves to learn more, become better, and work well with others, it's hard for me to have a sense of where I match up in the 'real world' of programmers. Also, gSchool is intense. If I'm not actively reading, working on a project, or in class, I'm either thinking about it or sleeping. How will having a job be different? What will I do with more personal time? There are technologies and techniques that I won't have time to pick up during gSchool, that I want to learn. There are project ideas swimming around in my head, and existing projects that I want to contribute to. I won't be bored, that's for sure!

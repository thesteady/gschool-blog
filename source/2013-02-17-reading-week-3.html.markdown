This week we read "Part I: The Basics" of _Eloquent Ruby_ by Russ Olsen. _Eloquent Ruby_ discusses Ruby language concepts in digestable chapters. I am finding it very enjoyable to read, despite it being a technical book, and it is helping me understand Ruby more fully.

I really enjoyed the chapter on Regular Expressions (chapter 5). Olsen explained all those dots and slashes clearly with examples. The first time I tried to use a Regular Expression, I was incredibly confused and intimidated by the mysterious formatting... but Olsen waved away the fog, and now I am prepared to tackle them. They're so useful! I definitely want to add them to my programming skillset, which will likely take a bit of practice.

I also found the chapter on symbols to be helpful. We've been using symbols in our projects for gSchool and while I've had a pretty good understanding of what they're doing in our projects, I'm not sure I really understood the underlying nature of them. I liked Olsen's summary of the difference between strings and symbols:

>"the Ruby String class is optimized for the data processing side of strings while symbols are meant to take over the 'stands for' role - hence the name." (p67)

It is highly likely that I have been using some strings when I could use symbols instead. I will be looking at my current project tomorrow for just that sort of thing!

While I now feel more confident about Regular Expressions and symbols, Olsen's writing on private vs. public methods (in the chapter on Ruby Objects) really confused me. I accidentally ran into a private method last week while experimenting with some code, and didn't really understand the brief explanations I read online about why I was getting the error. I was excited to see this section. The initial discussion of public/private/protected methods gave me a few "Aha!" moments. However, the last three sentences of the explanation took my understanding right back away. Olsen notes that despite the basic rules of a private method only working within its specified class, the programmer is boss, and can violate those rules. He doesn't explain how that works (or doesn't work). If you have a source of a good explanation, please let me know!

I'm looking forward to learning more about how to make my Ruby code more eloquent over the next couple of weeks. Check back next Monday for my thoughts on Part II of _Eloquent Ruby_!

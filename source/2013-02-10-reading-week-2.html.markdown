####gSchool Reading Assignment: _The Passionate Programmer_ by Chad Fowler, parts IV and V

For our second week of gSchool, our reading assignment was to finish Chad Fowler's _The Passionate Programmer_. The over-arching message I took away from this book was to be proactive and conscientious about your career by staying on top of market trends, always be learning something new, and be a valuable contributor to both your workplace and your coding community. The book reminded me a lot of various career advice and business books I've read in the past few years, but geared toward software developers. 

On Friday, Jeff talked to us about being our best professional selves and doing our best professional work. Finishing _The Passionate Programmer_ connected nicely with these ideas. In Fowler's tip "Better Than Yesterday," he discusses overcoming complex, seemingly insurmountable challenges by focusing on it in the acute. He says:

>"The secret is to focus on making whatever it is you're trying to improve _better today than it was yesterday_". 

I hope to apply this lesson to my work in gSchool. Our first individual project ([EventReporter](/2013/02/08/eventreporter-retrospective.html)) was overwhelming to me at first because it had a variety of components and there was a limited time in which to complete them. I wasn't able to make real progress until I stepped back and started breaking it up into small pieces. Counting a new working method as a success, and plugging away at the next one, kept me motivated and not bogged down with the thought of how much more I still needed to do. 

One of the tips that I enjoyed reading was "Release Your Code," which notes the importance of contributing to open source projects as a way to learn new skills, become a part of a community, and build a reputation within that community. I am excited that we'll actually be doing this as part of gSchool! Open source work is something I've been interested in for a while, but have felt intimidated by it and haven't really known where to start. I have been contributing data to [OpenStreetMap.org](http://openstreetmap.org), but would love to get more hands on with its development and documentation. We're also learning about a lot of open source tools in gSchool, so it would be great to give back to one of those as well.

This week we're starting _Eloquent Ruby_ by Russ Olsen. It looks interesting and I've heard good things about it, so I am looking forward to diving into it!

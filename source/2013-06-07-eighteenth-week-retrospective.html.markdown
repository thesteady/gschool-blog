Hola Amigos!

This week in gSchool, we....

1. Wrapped up and presented our individual projects.
2. I'm giving a Lightning Talk Today.
3. We get to hear from Dave Bacon of BW Bacon, a technical staffing company.


#### Project Retrospective

I am proud of how my individual project came out. There are plenty of features, refactorings, and tweaks that didn't make it, but I feel that the code and product I produced are solid and look good.

Seeing other people's projects, I felt like I didn't have much code. But, I think it's because I spent a good portion of my time learning MongoDB and figuring out the JavaScript for the map. Most of the code that directly affects my site user is JavaScript. This is the first project I've really dived into JS on -- I did small pieces of jQuery for a few previous projects -- and I found it be challenging! I am looking forward to learning JS better during the rest of gSchool. Working with the mapping JS involved using multiple layers of JS libraries: Mapbox's JS, which is based on/uses Leaflet JS, plus jQuery. Now that I understand this part of my project better, I think I could build another web map in half the time!

There's a lot of things I would still like to do with this project, so will likely keep working on it. For most of my project, I wasn't sure how I could build a gem from what I did -- but now I have an idea of how I could tweak it. I think I will try to make a gem that works with the Instagram gem (and API service) to pull in data from Instagram and have it prepped for throwing onto a map. Since my project used MongoDB, I would need to rewrite it for a SQL db, since I took advantage of some of Mongo's differences in my code. I would also need to figure out the best way to output the data. I am wrapping my data into GeoJSON for my map, but other maps might just want JSON. Things to think about.

#### Big Picture Thinking

I think the individual projects were good for the group as a whole -- morale is high and people are excited about code. 

I am excited about how far we have all come so far in gSchool. My individual project is definitely something I could not have done before starting the program. I was also really impressed by how different and awesome everyone else's projects were. With 6 weeks left, I think I will be REALLY impressed by the mastery projects!
